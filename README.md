# Elite Jeans
I developed Elite Jeans, a comprehensive platform for managing jeans and apparel products, built using the MERN stack. The frontend is crafted with React, Material-UI, Bootstrap, and custom libraries, ensuring a modern and user-friendly interface. On the backend, I used Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose, providing a scalable and efficient data management system. The platform allows users to upload jeans and apparel with detailed specifications, including pockets, skirts, pants, shirts, heights, sizes, and other attributes. Additionally, it supports order management, tech packs, POMs, spec templates, user roles, shipping, quotations, and vendor management. I also implemented email notifications to streamline communication and enhance the user experience. This project optimizes the workflow for apparel businesses, making product and order management seamless and efficient.
